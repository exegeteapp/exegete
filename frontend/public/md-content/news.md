**17 Nov 2022:** The highlight repetition tool can now be toggled on and off. Click on the icon in the Scripture Viewer toolbar to toggle on automatically generated highlighting of repeated words; click on it a second time, and these annotations will disappear. Any annotations you have made yourself will be unaffected, and will always take precedence over the automatically generated annotations.

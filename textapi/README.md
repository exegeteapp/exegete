# exegete.app: Text service

This service provides an interface to query texts, such as the Bible
(in various versions and translations), as well as writings by
Patristic authors. Texts made available from this API should be
fairly stable, and not prone to major updates.

This API is the initial focus for the exegete.app MVP.
